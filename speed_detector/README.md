# Speed Detector

## Description

The Speed Detector program takes as input the speed of a car and determines whether it is within the speed limit. If the speed is less than 70 km/h, it prints "Ok". Otherwise, for every 5 km/h above the speed limit (70 km/h), it gives the driver one demerit point and prints the total number of demerit points. If the driver accumulates more than 12 points, the program prints "License suspended".

## How to Use

### Run the program in a JavaScript environment or in a browser console

Enter the speed of the car in kilometers per hour (km/h).
The program will check if the speed is within the limit and display the appropriate message.

### Example

Enter speed (km/h): 80
Points: 2

Enter speed (km/h): 60
Ok

Enter speed (km/h): 95
Points: 5

Enter speed (km/h): 120
Points: 10, License suspended
